This value is concatenated with the country code, using a dot to delimit the two. For example, AFG.1, AFG.2, ..., AFG.n. If there are second level subdivisions, numeric codes are assigned within each first level subdivision and these are concatenated with the first level identifier, using a dot as delimiter. For example, AFG.1.1, AFG.1.2, AFG.1.3, ..., and AFG.2.1, AFG.2.2, .... And so forth for the third, fourth and fifth levels.
